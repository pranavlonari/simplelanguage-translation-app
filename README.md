1. Clone the Repository:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the `git clone` command to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```
   - Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   - Change your current working directory to the newly cloned repository:
     ```bash
     cd <repository_directory>
     ```
   - Replace `<repository_directory>` with the name of the directory created during the clone operation.

3. Open the Code in an Editor:
   - Use a code editor of your choice to open the project files. For example:
     ```bash
     code .
     ```
   - This command opens the project in Visual Studio Code. Adjust the command based on your preferred editor.

4. Replace API Key:
   - Open the `script.js` file.
   - Locate the line with `const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";`.
   - Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual API key for translation services. Save the file.

5. Run the Application:
   - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
   - Alternatively, set up a local development server to run the application. For example, you can use `Live Server` extension in Visual Studio Code.

6. Interact with the Application:
   - Use the language dropdowns to select the source and target languages.
   - Enter text in the textarea for translation.
   - Click the "Translate" button.

7. View the Translation Result:
   - The translated text will be displayed below the "Translated Text" heading on the webpage.

8. Testing:
   - Test the application with different source and target languages to ensure proper functionality.

9. Commit Changes:
   - If you make any modifications to the code, use the following commands to commit the changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Description of changes made"
     git push origin main
     ```
   - Replace the commit message with a brief description of the changes.
